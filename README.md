# Learning Flask REST JWT Authentication

With this app I plan to learn jwt authentication in Flask App.
Primary Goals are:

1. The app should have /signup, /signin & /signout routes
2. User password should be stored in hashed format.
3. Try to implement a /refresh_token route

Database Tables:

User: (id, username, email, password)
